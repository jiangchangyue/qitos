# Changelog

This project keeps a human-curated changelog so users and contributors can see how QitOS evolves over time.

Format:
- `Added`: new features and capabilities
- `Changed`: behavior changes, refactors, and structural improvements
- `Fixed`: bug fixes
- `Deprecated`: old paths or APIs that will be removed later
- `Removed`: deleted features
- `Breaking`: upgrade notes for incompatible changes

How to update:
- Add high-signal entries under `Unreleased` while work is in progress
- Move `Unreleased` notes into a dated or versioned section when publishing a release
- Prefer user-facing changes, upgrade notes, and important engineering changes over low-level edit logs

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a native tool-call decision lane for OpenAI-compatible family presets so Qwen-class endpoints can execute structured `tool_calls` before falling back to text parsers.
- Added bilingual Qwen best-practice docs explaining the native-lane-first harness strategy for `qwen-plus` and other OpenAI-compatible Qwen endpoints.

### Changed

- Upgraded the `qwen` family preset from generic JSON-first compatibility to native-tool-call-first behavior with text parser fallback.
- Preserved OpenAI-compatible raw responses inside the Engine runtime instead of flattening them to strings too early, while keeping direct text-oriented model calls available for existing authoring paths.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Added PR/push CI gates covering tests, packaging validation, stable-surface linting, and stable-surface type checking.
- Added dedicated maturity docs for architecture, development workflow, security reporting, community conduct, and environment configuration.
- Added an explicit `qitos.kit.tool.experimental.security_research` namespace for opt-in security research tool imports and registry builders.
- Added thin module boundaries for `qita` data/server/views and `render` terminal/themes façades to make future maintenance easier.
- Added a root-level changelog to document ongoing project evolution.
- Added a dedicated `requirements-dev.txt` entrypoint for full contributor installs from a local clone.
- Added stable `RunSpec`, `ExperimentSpec`, and `BenchmarkRunResult` public contracts to anchor reproducible-run metadata and normalized benchmark outputs.
- Added a first-pass unified `qit bench` CLI with `run`, `eval`, `replay`, and `export` subcommands.
- Added qita compare/diff views and export routes for summary-level run comparison.
- Added official-run and glossary docs, plus new reproducibility tutorials for benchmark runs and failed-run replay in both English and Chinese.
- Added a blog entry on why reproducible runs matter in QitOS.
- Added a first-class `qitos.harness` layer with `FamilyPreset`, `HarnessPolicy`, `ModelAdapter`, `ToolPolicy`, `ContextPolicy`, `build_harness_policy(...)`, and `build_model_for_preset(...)`.
- Added built-in gold presets for Qwen, Kimi, MiniMax, `gpt-oss`, and Gemma 4, plus bilingual docs for family presets, preset authoring, the model-family matrix, and same-example switching.
- Added `qit demo minimal`, a packaged minimal coding-agent demo that configures a real model, fixes a tiny workspace bug, and leaves behind a qita-ready trace.
- Added release notes for the first formal GitHub release package under `plans/releases/v0.3.0.md`.

### Changed

- Dropped Python 3.9 support and aligned CI, packaging metadata, README, and installation docs around Python 3.10+.
- Normalized the class-based tool contract around `execute(args, runtime_context)` while keeping `run(...)` as a compatibility path.
- Removed deprecated editor/codebase/file/shell compatibility shims in favor of the canonical `CodingToolSet` surface.
- Tightened default public exports from `qitos.kit` and `qitos.kit.tool` so experimental and higher-risk tool families are no longer part of the default surface.
- Preserved old security research import paths as short-term deprecation shims instead of keeping them as primary public entrypoints.
- Extracted shared coding-tool helper logic into internal utility modules to reduce coupling inside the canonical coding toolset.
- Slimmed `qita` and `render` entry modules so public behavior stays the same while implementation can evolve behind clearer boundaries.
- Reworked root installation guidance so `requirements.txt` is now a lightweight repo install path instead of a drifting copy of runtime and dev dependencies.
- Added coverage, dependency audit, and pre-commit tooling to the standard contributor workflow.
- Removed legacy root planning/audit scratch files, obsolete MkDocs configuration, and local phase-artifact directories so the repository surface matches the current Mintlify-based docs flow.
- Extended trace manifests with normalized run-spec, experiment-spec, benchmark, parser, and reproducibility metadata instead of keeping benchmark context in ad hoc side channels.
- Reworked benchmark example scripts so GAIA, Tau-Bench, and CyBench wrappers now emit the unified `BenchmarkRunResult` shape and route through the official v0.3 runner contract.
- Surfaced official-run and best-effort replay metadata inside qita board, run detail, and diff views.
- Updated benchmark, tracing, and CLI docs to position `qit bench` as the canonical benchmark path while keeping `examples/benchmarks` as thin wrappers.
- Refactored the flagship `examples/real/claude_code_agent.py` example into a preset-first showcase so the same agent can switch across supported model families without rewriting the agent implementation.
- Moved model-profile defaults onto preset-derived family data and extended context inference for the new v0.4 target families.
- Reworked README, quickstart, installation, CLI reference, and first-agent docs around the minimal coding-agent path so the public “minimal agent” story now matches the QitOS mindset: model config, workspace actions, verification, and qita inspection.
- Updated package metadata and contributor guidance so PyPI, docs, and release materials all describe QitOS as the torch-flavor framework for agent researchers.

### Fixed

- Fixed compatibility issues in direct `.run(...)` calls after the tool execution contract was normalized.
- Fixed the known undefined `target` reference in the exploit payload generation flow.
- Fixed stable-surface lint and mypy failures across `qitos/core`, `qitos/engine`, `qitos/models`, and `qitos/trace`.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated legacy security research import paths under `qitos.kit.tool.*_toolset` and `qitos.kit.tool.security_audit` in favor of explicit imports from `qitos.kit.tool.experimental.security_research`.

### Breaking

- Default root exports from `qitos.kit` and `qitos.kit.tool` no longer include advanced/security-audit convenience surfaces; import those explicitly from their module paths when needed.
