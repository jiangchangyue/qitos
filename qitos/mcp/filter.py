"""Tool name filtering for MCP server tool discovery.

When bridging MCP tools into QitOS, a ``ToolFilter`` controls which tools
are included and which are excluded.  This is useful when an MCP server
exposes many tools but only a subset is relevant for a given agent.

@dataclass
class ToolFilter:
    """Decides whether a tool name should be included when bridging MCP tools.

    Evaluation order:

    1. If ``filter_func`` is set, its result is authoritative (``True`` = keep).
    2. If ``allowed_tool_names`` is set, only names in the set are kept.
    3. If ``blocked_tool_names`` is set, names in the set are excluded.
    4. Otherwise the name passes (no filtering).

    You can combine allowed and blocked lists: a name must be in the
    allowed list (if set) AND not in the blocked list.

    Example::

        # Only include "search" and "read"
        f = ToolFilter(allowed_tool_names={"search", "read"})
