Primary objective:

Audit priorities:

- Authentication, authorization, session, and crypto handling
- Dangerous sinks such as command execution, SQL, redirects, file access, SSRF, and deserialization
- Secrets exposure and insecure configuration
- Dependency and supply-chain risk

Judgment rules:
- Treat tool output as evidence, not proof.
- Separate results into:
  1. confirmed issue
  2. high-value lead
  3. human review needed
- Prefer a small number of high-signal findings over a long noisy list.
- When confidence is low, say exactly what follow-up evidence is needed.
