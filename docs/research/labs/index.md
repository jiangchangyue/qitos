# 30-Min Labs (Build-From-Scratch Track)

These labs assume you already learned the QitOS core concepts.

The objective is not to read existing code first.
The objective is to **design and build** agent methods using QitOS contracts, then compare them with reproducible evidence.

## You will learn

1. how to define a research question in agent terms
2. how to implement strategy upgrades on one stable kernel
3. how to evaluate variants with consistent trace/metric criteria

## Setup

```bash
pip install qitos
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_key>"
```

If you are modifying QitOS itself while doing the labs, switch to editable install.

If not configured yet:

1. [Lab 1 - Build ReAct Baseline](lab1_react.md)
2. [Lab 2 - Upgrade ReAct to PlanAct](lab2_planact.md)
3. [Lab 3 - Upgrade PlanAct to Reflexion](lab3_reflexion.md)
